               Jurassic Park is a 1993 film starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough, written by David Koepp, 
               directed by Steven Spielberg. At the time of its release, Jurassic Park became the highest-grossing of all time, until the release 
               of Titanic in 1997. When it was re-released in 2013 for its 20th anniversary, it became the oldest film in history to make more 
               than $1 billion in ticket sales.

            <h1>Casting</h1>
               <h3>Alan Grant</h3>
                  <p>
                     The character of Alan Grant was based on real-life paleontologist Jack Horner, who was actually involved in coaching Sam
                     Neill, the actor who would eventually be cast to play the character. The role was offered to other actors as well, including 
                     William Hurt and Harrison Ford, who both rejected it saying that it wasn't their preferred type of film to be working on.
                  </p>

               <h3>Ian Malcolm</h3>
                  <p>
                     Interestingly, Ian Malcolm was not present in the original script of the film, the writer David Koepp saying that his 
                     character's dialogue in the book was "too wordy", implying that his character was difficult to adapt to the screenplay. 
                     Spielberg himself also considered taking the character out of the film, and it was only when he heard Jeff Goldblum's pitch
                     about playing the character that he was convinced to cast him for the role. 
                  </p>

               <h3>John Hammond</h3>
                  <p>
                     Spielberg's thoughts on John Hammond were that he was an eccentric businessman, that he wanted portrayed as the "dark side of
                     Walt Disney." Richard Attenborough, the actor who would eventually play the character, was hesitant at first to play the role, 
                     as it had been some time before he had acted in a film. Later, he accepted the part after being told by Spielberg that he 
                     "couldn't see anyone else playing it" but him.
