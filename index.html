               Overview
            </h1>
   
            
            <p>Jurassic Park is a 1993 film starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough, written by David Koepp, 
            directed by Steven Spielberg. At the time of its release, Jurassic Park became the highest-grossing of all time, until the release 
            of Titanic in 1997. When it was re-released in 2013 for its 20th anniversary, it became the oldest film in history to make more 
            than $1 billion in ticket sales.</p>

            <h1>Casting</h1>
               <h3>Alan Grant</h3>

                  <img src="images/Alan_Grant_(Sam_Neill).jpg" alt="Sam Neill photo" width="600" height="400">
                  <p>The character of Alan Grant was based on real-life paleontologist Jack Horner, who was actually involved in coaching Sam
                  Neill, the actor who would eventually be cast to play the character. The role was offered to other actors as well, including 
                  William Hurt and Harrison Ford, who both rejected it saying that it wasn't their preferred type of film to be working on.</p>

               <h3>Ian Malcolm</h3>
                  
                  <img src="images/Ian_Malcolm.jpg" alt="Best JP character" width="600" height="400">
                  <p>Interestingly, Ian Malcolm was not present in the original script of the film, the writer David Koepp saying that his 
                  character's dialogue in the book was &quot;too wordy&quot;, implying that his character was difficult to adapt to the screenplay. 
                  Spielberg himself also considered taking the character out of the film, and it was only when he heard Jeff Goldblum's pitch
                  about playing the character that he was convinced to cast him for the role.</p>

               <h3>John Hammond</h3>
                  
                  <img src="images/John_Hammond.jpg" alt="John Hammond picture" width="600" height="400">
                  <p>Spielberg's thoughts on John Hammond were that he was an eccentric businessman, that he wanted portrayed as the &quot;dark 
                  side of Walt Disney.&quot; Richard Attenborough, the actor who would eventually play the character, was hesitant at first to 
                  play the role, as it had been some time since he had last acted in a film. Later, he accepted the part after being told by 
                  Spielberg that he &quot;couldn't see anyone else playing it&quot; but him.</p>

            <h1>Production Issues</h1>
               <h3>Hurricane Iniki</h3>
                  
                  <img src="images/hurricane_iniki.jpg" alt="Hurricane Iniki footage" width="600" height="400">
                  <p>During production, there was a hurricane that hit the island of Kaua'l in Hawaii, the location that was used to portray Isla 
                  Nublar, the setting where most of the movie takes place. Although no one was injured in this natural disaster, the sets were 
                  completely destroyed, which forced the crew to have to cut scenes from the movie, including one where the character Ray Arnold, 
                  played by Sam Jackson, meets his end at the hands of Velociraptors. Despite this, some crew members were able to endure the 
                  hurricane, and obtained footage of it, which can be seen in the final cut of the film when the Jurassic Park employees are 
                  trying to evacuate by boat from the island.</p>

               <h3>Tyrannosaurus Rain</h3>
                  
                  <img src="images/t_rex_rain.jpeg" alt="T-Rex in the rain">
                  <p>The Tyrannosaurus Rex in the movie was created by using an animatronic robot, and partialy use of CGI. With the animatronic 
                  model, the crew sometimes faced issues during rainfall sequences, when the large amount of water weight would throw the model 
                  off-balance, forcing the crew to have to dry it off between takes. At times, this water weight issue became so bad that the model
                  began to move on its own, which can be seen in the scene when the T-Rex breaks through the sunroof of the Jeep the two children, 
                  Lex and Tim, were in.</p>

            <h1>Cool Effects</h1>
               <h3>Water Ripple Effect</h3>

                  <img src="images/water_cups.jpg" alt="Water Ripple Effect" width="600" height="400">
                  <p>One of the most famous scenes in the movie, this effect was done by visual effects supervisor Michael Lantieri, by attaching
                  guitar strings to the base of each water cup and plucking the strings at the right times. Interestingly, this iconic moment was
                  inspired in part by the song &quot;September&quot;, by Earth, Wind & Fire, which Spielberg was listening to while driving one day, when 
                  he happened to notice that his rearview mirror was shaking and vibrating from the noise.</p>

               <h3>Sick Triceratops</h3>

                  <img src="images/sick_triceratops.jpg" alt="Sick Triceratops" width="600" height="400">
                  <p>In a scene where the characters are walking through the Park, they come across a sick Triceratops. This scene was done with a 
                  fully animatronic model, operated with cables by 8 puppeteers directly underneath the model, and by an additional 4 puppeteers
                  that operated the back of the model. Initially, the model was colored purple, yellow, red, and green for the scene, but the 
                  main technician behind the live-action effects, Stan Winston, disapproved, saying &quot;this looks ridiculous, make it brown.
                  &quot;</p>

               <h3>Raptor Puppets</h3>

                  <img src="images/raptor_egg.jpg" alt="Raptor Egg" width="600" height="400">
                  <p>The scene where a Velociraptor hatchling emerges from a dinosaur egg was originally going to be a baby Triceratops that was 
                  operated by a small finger puppet poking out of the egg. This idea was eventually scrapped, and Spielberg decided he wanted it 
                  to be a baby Velociraptor crawling out. Initially, the approach was to use wires and strings to control the puppet, until
                  Richard Landon, the mechanical department coordinator on the film said he would design an animatronic that could be used instead.
                  The final model for the baby Velociraptor ended up being an animatronic puppet controlled internally by Landon himself, while the
                  egg was molded by Greg Figiel, an FX artist, who made it using wax and a layer of plastic wrap.</p>
